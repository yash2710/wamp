Tech

FreePBX UCP uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Asterisk] - Asterisk is a software implementation of a telephone private branch exchange (PBX) (Supported Versions 1.8 through 12). License GPL
* [jQuery] - A multi-browser JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. License MIT
* [jQueryUI] - jQuery UI is a JavaScript library that provides abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets, built on top of the jQuery JavaScript library, that can be used to build interactive web applications. License MIT
* [bootstrap] - a free collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.
* [CssMin] - A (simple) css minifier with benefits. By Joe Scylla, Copyright (c) 2008 - 2010. License MIT
